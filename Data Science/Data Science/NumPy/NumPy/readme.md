- **<h1>NumPy</h1>**
- NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source library for the Python programming language that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.<br><br>

- **Core Data Structure**: The core data structure in NumPy is the **ndarray** (n-dimensional array), which is a powerful N-dimensional array object.<br><br>

- **Array Creation**: NumPy offers various functions to create arrays:
  - **array()**: Converts input data (list, tuple, array, or other sequence types) to an ndarray.
  - **zeros()**: Creates an array filled with zeros.
  - **ones()**: Creates an array filled with ones.
  - **arange()**: Creates an array with evenly spaced values within a given range.
  - **linspace()**: Creates an array with evenly spaced values between specified intervals.<br><br>

- **Array Operations**: NumPy supports element-wise operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports matrix operations, such as dot products and cross products.<br><br>

- **Broadcasting**: NumPy's broadcasting feature allows you to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes in a flexible way.<br><br>

- **Indexing and Slicing**: You can access and modify parts of an ndarray using indexing and slicing, similar to Python lists.<br><br>

- **Statistical Functions**: NumPy provides a wide range of statistical functions, such as **mean()**, **median()**, **std()** (standard deviation), and more.<br><br>

- **Linear Algebra**: The library includes numerous linear algebra functions, such as those for computing eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and singular value decomposition (SVD).<br><br>

- **Random Number Generation**: NumPy's random module enables you to generate random numbers, arrays, and perform random sampling.<br><br>

- **Integration with Other Libraries**: NumPy is compatible with other scientific computing libraries in Python, such as SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, making it an essential tool in the data science and machine learning ecosystem.
