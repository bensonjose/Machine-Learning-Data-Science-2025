- **<h1>Pandas</h1>**<br>
-  **Pandas** is an open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python, providing data structures and functions needed to work seamlessly with structured data.<br><br>

- **Data Structures**: Pandas primarily uses two data structures:<br>
  - **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.<br>
  - **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types, like an Excel spreadsheet or SQL table.<br><br>

- **Data Handling**: Pandas allows for easy handling of missing data, including functions to drop or fill in missing values.<br><br>

- **Data Alignment**: Automatic and explicit data alignment is supported, which means operations align on both row and column labels.<br><br>

- **Intelligent Label-Based Slicing**: You can access and manipulate data using labels (names) as well as position-based (integer) slicing.<br><br>

- **Flexible Data Manipulation**: You can reshape and pivot datasets through functions like **pivot_table**, **stack**, and **unstack**.<br><br>

- **Group By Functionality**: Pandas provides functionality to split the data, apply a function, and combine the results, making it easy to aggregate and transform datasets.<br><br>

- **Merging and Joining**: Combining data from multiple DataFrames is straightforward using functions like **merge** and **join**.<br><br>

- **Time Series Analysis**: Pandas has robust support for time series data, including date range generation, frequency conversion, and moving window statistics.<br><br>

- **Input and Output Tools**: It supports reading and writing data in a variety of formats, including **CSV**, **Excel**, **SQL databases**, and **HDF5**.<br><br>

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Pandas provides powerful, expressive, and flexible data analysis tools, such as **groupby**, **aggregation**, and **apply** methods.
