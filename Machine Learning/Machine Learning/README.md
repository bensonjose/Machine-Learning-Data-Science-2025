## Machine Learning algorithms.

### In this repository, I have explained and given the code for ML algorithms in a simple and concise manner!

#### 1.Linear Regression
Linear regression is a model that estimates the linear relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. <br>A model with exactly one explanatory variable is a simple linear regression; a model with two or more explanatory variables is a multiple linear regression.<br>

#### 2.Logistic Regression
 A logistic model is a statistical model that models the log-odds of an event as a linear combination of one or more independent variables. <br>In regression analysis, logistic regression estimates the parameters of a logistic model.<br>


 #### 3.KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)
 The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning method used for both classification and regression, where a data point's classification or prediction is determined by the majority class or average value of its nearest neighbors in the training data. 


 #### 4.SVM (Support Vector Machine)
 A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks, aiming to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points into different classes by maximizing the margin between them. <br>

 #### 5.Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a simple, probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, used for classification tasks, that assumes features are independent of each other.
