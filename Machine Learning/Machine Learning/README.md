### Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (often called the target or outcome) and one or more independent variables (also known as predictors or features). The goal is to find a linear equation that best predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variables.

In its simplest form, with one independent variable, linear regression fits a straight line to the data. The equation for this line is typically written as:

## y = mx + b

#### y is the dependent variable (what you're trying to predict).
#### x is the independent variable (what you use to make the prediction).
#### m is the slope of the line (how much y changes for a unit change in x).
#### b is the intercept (the value of y when x is 0).

For example, if you’re trying to predict someone’s house price (y) based on its size in square feet (x), linear regression would find the best-fitting line through the data points to estimate how size influences price.

When there are multiple independent variables (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location), it becomes multiple linear regression, and the equation expands to:

## y = b₀ + b₁x₁ + b₂x₂ + ... + bₙxₙ

Here, b₀ is the intercept, and b₁, b₂, ... , bₙ are the coefficients for each independent variable x₁, x₂, ... , xₙ.

The "best fit" is usually determined by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the actual values and the predicted values (a method called least squares). It’s widely used in fields like economics, science, and machine learning because it’s simple, interpretable, and provides a foundation for more complex models.
